**Hello everyone!** This is an **ambitious project**. We have many goals yet to be achieved and we would **appreciate** any and all help. We are happy to make the **source code** of our server available, many of the Enum already created are in correct order and with their proper typing for writing packages. Use the server as you wish, we have no restrictions as long as you assign credits to this repository.
